## Setup

This web application is comprised of two parts: client and server. Both of them are run separately; following sections guide you through its setup.

### Client setup

The following steps should be taken to set-up client side of this web application:

```bash
cd client # If not inside already
npm i
npm run dev 
```

This opens the dev server on port 5173. Alternatively, one may build the entire client side using `npm run build` instead.

### Server setup
